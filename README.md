## Handwritten Digit Recognition Model
This repository provides a Python implementation of a handwritten digit recognition model using the Keras deep learning library. The model, trained on the MNIST dataset, achieves high accuracy on the test set.
## Overview
The project demonstrates how to build, train, and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) for digit recognition. The workflow includes loading the dataset, normalizing and reshaping the data, building the model, training it with callbacks, and evaluating its performance.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python packages installed:

- `numpy` for numerical computations
- `matplotlib` for plotting images
- `tensorflow` for Keras API and model training


You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install tensorflow
```
